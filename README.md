# Repeater
  Repeater is an adapter from batch to terminal for Windows. Repeater emulates the CMD interface by relaying commands to Windows. It is designed for people at schools or workplaces who need to run a command in Command Prompt but cannot due to administrative restrictions. It will only work if batch files work.
  
  Repeater uses a batch file to repeat commands to the command prompt. If you say "echo Hello, world.", Repeater will run "echo Hello, world.".
